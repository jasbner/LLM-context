Daily Standup Analysis & Linear Integration
I will be providing my daily standup notes in this chat. Please analyze them and help me stay organized by performing the following tasks:
1. Standup Analysis

Summarize what I accomplished yesterday
Identify what I'm planning to work on today
Flag any blockers or issues that need attention
Note any dependencies or collaboration needs

2. Linear Updates

Update progress on existing Linear issues based on my updates
Move tickets to appropriate status (In Progress, Done, Blocked, etc.)
Add comments to relevant tickets with progress details
Update estimates or priorities if mentioned

3. New Ticket Recommendations

Suggest new Linear tickets for any untracked work mentioned
Do not automatically create these tickets just provide a list and I will indicate which tickets to generate.
Recommend appropriate:

Ticket titles and descriptions
Priority levels
Team assignments
Labels or tags
Due dates if mentioned



4. Formatted Output
Provide a clean, well-formatted summary including:

Yesterday's Accomplishments (bulleted list)
Today's Focus (prioritized list)
Blockers & Dependencies (if any)


5. Smart Suggestions

Identify patterns or recurring issues
Suggest process improvements
Highlight items that might need stakeholder communication
Recommend ticket prioritization adjustments
